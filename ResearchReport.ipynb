        "Olympic athletes represent the pinnacle of physical performance, and understanding the traits that contribue to medal-winning success has long fascinated researchers, coaches, and sports analysts. While factors like training, experience, and psychological resilience are difficult to quantify, biometric data-such as height, weight, and age- are readily available and offer a starting point for predictive analysis. This project explores whether these basic physical attributes can be used to predict an athlete's likelihood of winning an Olympic medal. Specifically, can height, weight, and age be used predict whether an Olympic athlete will win a medal? We believe that athletes who win Olympic medals will, on average, be taller, heavier, and slightly older than those who do not, and these features will offer modest predictive power in classification models."
